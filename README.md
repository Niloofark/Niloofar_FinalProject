** Predicting Income levels Using Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms: A Study on the United States Census 1994 Dataset **

This project aims to predict the income level of individuals using socio-economic features from the United States Census 1994 dataset: by employing several Supervised Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. The main objective of this study is to classify people’s income into two levels, below or equal to $50k or higher than $50k in a year. This study incorporates machine learning model selection, data preprocessing, and exploration, followed by model deployment and evaluation, and a comparative analysis of the model’s performance. The study indicates a major bias in income distribution, gender inequality in terms of income, and other significant insights. The highest performance is offered by the XGBoost model, which has the highest evaluation metrics among all models used in the study; other models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting are highly accurate, with slight differences from XGBoost. However, the Decision Tree, Neural Network, and Support Vector machine showed lower performance which might be affected by various reasons such as class imbalances. 


Overall, 8 classification ML models are used in the study and based on various comprehensive evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, cross-validation score, confusion matrix, and more, the models are divided into high-performance and low-performance models.

High-performance:
1. Logistic Regression
2. K-NN
3. Random Forest
4. Gradient Boosting
5. XGBoost

Low-perfromance:
6. Decision Tree
7. Neural Network
8. Support Vector Machine
