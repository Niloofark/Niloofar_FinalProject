# Niloofar_FinalProject


Initially, the project consisted of 8 classification models:
1. Logistic Regression
2. K-NN
3. Random Forest
4. Gradient Boosting
5. XGBoost
6. Decision Tree
7. Neural Network
8. Support Vector Machine


After analyzing all models' performance, 5 models were chosen to be high-performance models, and 3 models were chosen to be low-performance models which are located in different Jupyter notebooks in this repository. 
High-performance:
1. Logistic Regression
2. K-NN
3. Random Forest
4. Gradient Boosting
5. XGBoost

Low-perfromance:
6. Decision Tree
7. Neural Network
8. Support Vector Machine
